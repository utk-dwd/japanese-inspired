            What is needed is an electronic payment system based on cryptographic proof instead of trust,
            third party. Transactions that are computationally impractical to reverse would protect sellers
            from fraud, and routine escrow mechanisms could easily be implemented to protect buyers. In
            this paper, <br> we propose a solution to the double-spending problem using a peer-to-peer distributed
            timestamp server to generate computational proof of the chronological order of transactions. The
            system is secure as long as honest nodes collectively control more CPU power than any
            cooperating group of attacker nodes. <br> We need a way for the payee to know that the previous owners did not sign any earlier
            transactions. For our purposes, the earliest transaction is the one that counts, so we don't care
            about later attempts to double-spend. The only way to confirm the absence of a transaction is to
            be aware of all transactions. In the mint based model, the mint was aware of all transactions and
            decided which arrived first. To accomplish this without a trusted party, transactions must be
            publicly announced [1], and we need a system for participants to agree on a single history of the
            order in which they were received. The payee needs proof that at the time of each transaction, the
            majority of nodes agreed it was the first received. <br> The solution we propose begins with a timestamp server. A timestamp server works by taking a
            hash of a block of items to be timestamped and widely publishing the hash, such as in a
            newspaper or Usenet post [2-5]. The timestamp proves that the data must have existed at the
            time, obviously, in order to get into the hash. Each timestamp includes the previous timestamp in
            its hash, forming a chain, with each additional timestamp reinforcing the ones before it.
             <br><br> The proof-of-work also solves the problem of determining representation in majority decision
             making. If the majority were based on one-IP-address-one-vote, it could be subverted by anyone
             able to allocate many IPs. Proof-of-work is essentially one-CPU-one-vote. The majority
             decision is represented by the longest chain, which has the greatest proof-of-work effort invested
             in it. If a majority of CPU power is controlled by honest nodes, the honest chain will grow the
             fastest and outpace any competing chains.<br> To modify a past block, an attacker would have to
             redo the proof-of-work of the block and all blocks after it and then catch up with and surpass the
             work of the honest nodes. We will show later that the probability of a slower attacker catching up
             diminishes exponentially as subsequent blocks are added.<br>
             To compensate for increasing hardware speed and varying interest in running nodes over time,
             the proof-of-work difficulty is determined by a moving average targeting an average number of
             blocks per hour. If they're generated too fast, the difficulty increases. <br> 'Nodes always consider the longest chain to be the correct one and will keep working on
             extending it. If two nodes broadcast different versions of the next block simultaneously, some
             nodes may receive one or the other first. In that case, they work on the first one they received,
             but save the other branch in case it becomes longer. The tie will be broken when the next proofof-work is found and one branch becomes longer; the nodes that were working on the other
             branch will then switch to the longer one. <br><br> The incentive may help encourage nodes to stay honest. If a greedy attacker is able to
             assemble more CPU power than all the honest nodes, he would have to choose between using it
             to defraud people by stealing back his payments, or using it to generate new coins
